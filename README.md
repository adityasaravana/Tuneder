# Tuneder
Tuneder is the successor to SoundSieve (https://github.com/wilzh40/SoundSieve), an open-source iOS app that helps Apple Music users discover new songs with a Tinder-like UI. 

(Make sure to turn on sound)


Tuneder's still in a very early testing phase, and is in no way ready for the App Store. If you run across a bug, find something in the app annoying, or have a suggestion to improve the UI, feel free to open an issue or clone the repository and email me at aditya.saravana@icloud.com about contributing to Tuneder's development. All contributors will be added below, and put in the credits section of the app on the App Store.
